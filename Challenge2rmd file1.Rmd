## R Markdown and regular expressions
This is an R Markdown document that describes regular expression to match patterns. Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as code, log files, spreadsheets, or even documents.Below is the code in R to match some patterns.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#load library for string r and i
library(stringr)
library(stringi)

```



a)times after noon, but before midnight when reported in 24-hour or military format (e.g. 15:30)
#create a file with some military time format data
#load data
#write regex for time = "[1][2][:][0-9][1-9]|[1][3-9][:][0-9]{2}|[2][0-9][:][0-9]{2}"


```{r militarytimeformat}

data = scan(file="militarytimeformat.txt",what=character(),sep="\n")
data
```


```{r}
grep("([1][2][:][0-9][1-9]|[1][3-9][:][0-9]{2}|[2][0-9][:][0-9]{2})", data)
```

The logical OR "|" is used to separate three different expressions.
The regex before first | indicates pattern to match times 12 hr to 12:59 hrs and 
regex between two | for 13:00 to 19:59 hrs and after | indicates pattern to match 20 hrs to 24 hrs.

Regex "[1][2][:][0-9][1-9]" will only match times 12 hr to 12:59 hrs because the first two characters are 1 and 2 and are # absolute matches.

Regex "[1][3-9][:][0-9]{2}" matches times from 13 to 19:59 and not 12:01 to 12:59 because the second character represented # here by 3-9 means any digit from 3 to 9 and not 2 or 1, thus does not match 11 or 12 hrs.

Regex "[2][0-9][:][0-9]{2}"" matches only hrs starting from 20:00 as the first character is an absolute match to 2.



b) Genus species names expressed in the format G. species (e.g. H. sapien)
#create a file with genus and species names of different formats
#load data
#write regex

```{r}

asp=scan(file = "animalspecies.txt",what = character(),sep = "\n")

#asp
#[1] "H.sapien"   "P.leo"      "R.pumilio"  "sapien.H"   "H.SAPIEN"   "Homosapien" "homosapien" "h.sapiens"

#speciesnames= "[A-Z][.]([a-z]+)"

```

The regex [A-Z][.]([a-z]+) will only match names with format H.sapien and print only the species name. In the names listed in the file asp, for instance for the name P.leo - matches the regex as the first character genera is represented only by a capital letter matched by [A-Z], while its species name is written in small letter preceeded by a period. The regex will neither match "Homosapien" as the genus name is written in full nor will match "homosapien" as the genus name is written in full and in small letters. The regex will not match "h.sapiens" as the genus name is written in small letters.


```{r}
grep("([A-Z][.]([a-z]+))", asp)


```



c) Social security numbers (e.g 389-05-4771)
#create a file with numbers having format similar to social security numbers and those which do not have a similar format
#load data
#write regex

```{r}
ssndata=scan(file = "ssns.txt", what = character(), sep = "\n")
ssndata

# [1] "123-66-1234"  "11-123-11111" "234-23-2345"  "111-0-1234"   "111-00-1"   

#ssn="([0-9]{3}[-][0-9]{2}[-][0-9]{4})"


```



This ssn regex only matches ssns, "123-66-1234" and "234-23-2345", because the first set of numbers have 3 digits, second have 2, and the third set have 4 digits and the sets are separated by "-". Here for instance take the last number "111-00-1", the regex will not match as even though the first two sets of nubers match our pattern of have 3 and 2 digits respectively - the last set should have 4 digits and this number has only one digit. Similarly, the regex will not match "111-0-1234" as its middle set of numbers have only 1 digit instead of two. The regex does not match the number "11-123-11111" either because, the first set of numbers have only two digits and the last set have more than 4.

```{r}

grep("([0-9]{3}[-][0-9]{2}[-][0-9]{4})",ssndata)

```
